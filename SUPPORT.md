## :question: Do you have a question?

> Search Stack Overflow first; discuss if necessary

If you're unsure why something isn't working or wondering if there is a better
way of doing it please check on Stack Overflow first and if necessary start
a discussion. Use the [`project-reactor`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/project-reactor) tag for that purpose.

If you prefer real-time discussion, we also have a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor).

We generally discourage opening GitHub issues for questions, in favor of the two channels above.
