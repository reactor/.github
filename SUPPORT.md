## :question: Do you have a question?

> Search Stack Overflow first; discuss if necessary

If you're unsure why something isn't working or wondering if there is a better
way of doing it please check on **Stack Overflow** first and if necessary start
a discussion. Use relevant tags among the ones we monitor for that purpose:
 - [`reactor-netty`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reactor-netty) for specific reactor-netty questions
 - [`project-reactor`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/project-reactor) for generic reactor questions

If you prefer real-time discussion, we also have a few **Gitter channels**:
 - [`reactor`](https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor) is the historic most active one, where most of the community can help
 - [`reactor-core`](https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor-core) is intended for more advanced pinpointed discussions around the inner workings of the library
 - [`reactor-netty`](https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor-netty) is intended for netty-specific questions

Refer to each project's README for potential other sources of information.
	
We generally discourage opening GitHub issues for questions, in favor of the two channels above.
